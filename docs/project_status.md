## Detailed Gap Analysis

### Dataset Creation Issues

**Current Limitations**:
```python
# Current simplistic approach
business_types = [
    "organic coffee shop",  # Only 12 categories
    "AI SaaS startup",
    # ... limited diversity
]

def generate_domain_name(description: str) -> str:
    words = description.lower().split()
    core = ''.join(random.sample(words, min(3, len(words))))
    # Too simplistic, doesn't follow real branding principles
```

**Needed Improvements**:
```python
# Enhanced approach needed
class AdvancedDatasetCreator:
    def __init__(self):
        self.business_categories = load_comprehensive_categories()  # 50+ categories
        self.real_domain_patterns = load_successful_domains()      # Real examples
        self.branding_rules = load_branding_heuristics()          # Professional rules
        
    def generate_quality_domains(self, business_desc):
        # Apply real branding principles
        # Check domain availability
        # Validate with multiple quality metrics
```

### Evaluation Methodology Gaps

**Current Evaluation**:
- Basic relevance/brandability scoring
- No human validation
- Limited edge case analysis
- No user satisfaction tracking

**Missing Components**:
- Comprehensive scoring rubrics with clear criteria
- Inter-rater reliability studies
- User acceptance testing with real businesses
- Longitudinal performance tracking
- Systematic bias detection and mitigation

### Model Training Deficiencies

**Current Training**:
```python
# Basic fine-tuning
training_args = TrainingArguments(
    per_device_train_batch_size=8,
    num_train_epochs=5,
    # ... minimal configuration
)
```

**Advanced Training Needed**:
```python
# Enhanced training pipeline
class AdvancedTrainingPipeline:
    def __init__(self):
        self.curriculum_stages = ["simple", "medium", "complex"]
        self.multi_task_objectives = [
            "domain_generation",
            "domain_evaluation", 
            "business_classification"
        ]
        self.ensemble_models = ["creative", "conservative", "brandable"]
```
